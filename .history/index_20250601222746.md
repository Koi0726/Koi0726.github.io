# About Me

<img src="bike_lgw.jpg" class="floatpic">

Here is **Guangwei Liu (koi, 刘光炜)**.<br>

I am currently a PhD student in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Nagoya University, advised by [Prof. Junji Kato](https://profs.provost.nagoya-u.ac.jp/html/100010137_ja.html), within the [Laboratory of Computational Mechanics and Optimal Design](https://www.nuopt.org/). 

I worked as a Marine Engineer at [ZPMC](https://www.zpmc.com/) for Naval Architecture and Offshore Vessel design and construction supervision, during which I obtained years of project management experience with a [PMP](https://www.pmi.org/certifications/project-management-pmp) certificate.

I am also a practitioner of new product development. I own a membership of [PDMA](https://www.pdma.org/) and acted as lecturer for strategy of new product development.

I welcome inquiries and collaboration on my research. Please feel free to contact me via:
- liu.guangwei.t0 [at] s.mail.nagoya-u.ac.jp

## Research Interests

- [Topology Optimization](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=topology+optimization&btnG=) of Dynamic Problems with Material Nonlinearity
- Quantum Computing Based Optimization Methods
- Acceleration Optimization via Machine Learning

My PhD research focuses on load control and energy manipulation of viscoelastic materials via topology optimization. Besides, I am also interested in advanced optimization acceleration techniques and conducted some practices during my PhD study.

My short-term interests are on Soft Robots, including wearable devices, soft grippers, and locomotive compliant mechanisms. I believe that soft matters of robotics will go first into industrial applications with delicate design. My long-term interests are in the Synthesis of Soft and Hard Robotics, a comprehensive and cooperative mechanism leading the society’s technologies.
