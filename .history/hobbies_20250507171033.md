# Hobbies

This page hasn’t been updated for a long time. Over the past year, I’ve remained passionate about swimming, but the lack of convenient and decent swimming pools in Cambridge has been an inconvenience. As a result, I’ve been swimming less frequently and have gained some weight. If you’re also in Cambridge and interested in swimming, running, or hiking together, feel free to contact me!

## Body Fitness & Powerlifting

<br>For many people, powerlifting may be a very tiring thing. But in fact, for those who do mental work, it is a very good way to relieve stress. About ten years ago, I switched from poppin to powerlifting, and systematically learned the knowledge of NSCA-CPT. Now I keep the habit of powerlifting and other resistance training exercises, and can guide my friends around me to do simple training. If you also like this kind of sport, please contact me, let's make progress together.

## Music & Guitar

<br>To some degrees, I am a player of life. I like and enjoy the process of holding a beautiful guitar in my hands and playing it and making it sound pleasant.


## Past Hobbies

I previously practiced Poppin, a very popular street dance type. Actually, I was the lead dancer of a Popping group of a street dance club at my bachelor’s university. I have no time to do any of these things recently.

## My Vault

I have several acoustic guitars and electric guitars. They accompanied me for a lot of time.
