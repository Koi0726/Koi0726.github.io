# About Me

<img src="bike_lgw.jpg" class="floatpic">

Here is **Guangwei Liu (koi, 刘光炜)**.<br>

I am a graduate student in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Nagoya University, advised by [Prof. Junji Kato](https://profs.provost.nagoya-u.ac.jp/html/100010137_ja.html), within [Laboratory of Computational Mechanics and Optimal Design](https://www.nuopt.org/). 

I worked as Marine Engineer at [ZPMC](https://www.zpmc.com/) for Offshore Suport Vessels design and construction supervision, during which I obtained years of project management experience with the Project Management Professional ![(PMP)](/images/PMP_certificate.pdf) certificate.
I am also a practitioner of new product development. I own a membership of Product Development and Management Associtation ([PDMA](https://www.pdma.org/)) and acted as lecturer for strategy of new product development.

I also spent a lovely summer research program with [Prof. Pietro Liò](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pl219/) at [Artificial Intelligence Group](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/ai/). Prior to Cambridge,  I have worked on System Engineering, Cybersecurity and Wireless Communication with [Prof. Zhezhuang Xu](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=iZ7LQRkAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and [Dr. Meng Yuan](https://myuan27.github.io/).

I welcome inquiries and collaboration on my research. Please feel free to contact me via:
