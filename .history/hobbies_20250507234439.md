# Hobbies

Even if this page will not be updated for a long time, and I may temporarily stop doing some hobbies because of work, but these hobbies mean who I am. Work is not everything in life. Hobbies make me a better person.

## Motorcycle Touring

<br>It is really interesting to travel around the world with direct contact with sunshine and wind. I often ride my little motorcycle to different places and make new friends on the trip. I can repair a motorcycle with my mechanical engineering background. It makes it easier to reach the world further. Through the repairing work, I also learned to be a designer and planner.



## Body Fitness & Powerlifting

<br>For many people, powerlifting may be a very tiring thing. But in fact, for those who do mental work, it is a very good way to relieve stress. About ten years ago, I switched from poppin to powerlifting, and systematically learned the knowledge of NSCA-CPT. Now I keep the habit of powerlifting and other resistance training exercises, and can guide my friends around me to do simple training. If you also like this kind of sport, please contact me, let's make progress together.

## Music & Guitar

<br>To some degrees, I am a player of life. I like and enjoy the process of holding a beautiful guitar in my hands and playing it and making it sound pleasant.


## Past Hobbies

I previously practiced Poppin, a very popular street dance type. Actually, I was the lead dancer of a Popping group of a street dance club at my bachelorâ€™s university. I have no time to do any of these things recently.
