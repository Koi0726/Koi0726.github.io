# About Me

<img src="bike_lgw.jpg" class="floatpic">

Here is **Guangwei Liu (koi, 刘光炜)**.<br>

I am currently a PhD student in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Nagoya University, advised by [Prof. Junji Kato](https://profs.provost.nagoya-u.ac.jp/html/100010137_ja.html), within the [Laboratory of Computational Mechanics and Optimal Design](https://www.nuopt.org/). 

I worked as a Marine Engineer at [ZPMC](https://www.zpmc.com/) for Naval Architecture and Offshore Vessel design and construction supervision, during which I obtained years of project management experience with a [PMP](https://www.pmi.org/certifications/project-management-pmp) certificate.

I am also a practitioner of new product development. I own a membership of [PDMA](https://www.pdma.org/) and acted as lecturer for strategy of new product development.

I welcome inquiries and collaboration on my research. Please feel free to contact me via:

## Research Interests

- [Topology Optimization](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=topology+optimization&btnG=)
- Dynamic Problems with Material Nonlinearity
- Quntum Computing Based Topology Optimization
- Acceleration Optimization via Machine Learning

My current research focuses on load control and energy manipulation of viscoelastic materials via topology optimization. My interests are on the Soft Robots including wearble devices, soft grippers and locomotive compliant mechanisms. I believe that soft matters of robotics will go first into industrial application with delicate design. 
I am also interested in advanced optimization acceleration techniques. After all, who wants to lag behind the state of the art?
